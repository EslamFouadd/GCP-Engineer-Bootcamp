/* Improve model performance with feature engineering
As was hinted at earlier, there are many more features in the dataset that may help the model better understand the relationship between a visitor's first session and the likelihood that they will purchase on a subsequent visit.

Add some new features and create a second machine learning model called classification_model_2:

How far the visitor got in the checkout process on their first visit

Where the visitor came from (traffic source: organic search, referring site etc.)

Device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Geographic information (country)
