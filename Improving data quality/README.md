# Improving data quality

In this lab, you will present and solve some of the most common issues of "untidy" data. Note that different problems will require different methods, and they are beyond the scope.

# Overview
Machine learning models can only consume numeric data, and that numeric data should be 1s or 0s. Data is said to be messy or untidy if it is missing attribute values, contains noise or outliers, has duplicates, wrong data, or upper/lower case column names, or is essentially not ready for ingestion by a machine learning algorithm.

In this lab, you will present and solve some of the most common issues of untidy data. Note that different problems will require different methods, and they are beyond the scope of this notebook.

# Objectives
In this lab, you will learn how to:

Resolve missing values.

Convert the Date feature column to a datetime format.

Rename a feature column, remove a value from a feature column.

Create one-hot encoding features.

Understand temporal feature conversions.
