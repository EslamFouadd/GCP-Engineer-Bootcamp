## Introduction to Vertex AI

This lab uses the newest AI product offering available on Google Cloud. Vertex AI integrates the ML offerings across Google Cloud into a seamless development experience. Previously, models trained with AutoML and custom models were accessible via separate services. The new offering combines both into a single API, along with other new products. You can also migrate existing projects to Vertex AI. If you have any feedback, see the Google Cloud, Vertex AI Support page.

Vertex AI includes many different products to support end-to-end ML workflows. This lab focuses on the products highlighted below: Training/HP-Tuning and Notebooks.
