# Using an image dataset to train an AutoML model

In this lab, we will create an image classification dataset and import images, train an AutoML image classification model, deploy a model to an endpoint and send a prediction.

# Overview

In this lab, you create an image classification dataset and import images, train an AutoML image classification model, deploy a model to an endpoint, and send a prediction.

# Learning objectives

Create an image classification dataset and import images.

Train an AutoML image classification model.

Deploy a model to an endpoint and send a prediction.


# Introduction to Vertex AI

This lab uses the newest AI product offering available on Google Cloud. Vertex AI integrates the ML offerings across Google Cloud into a seamless development experience. Previously, models trained with AutoML and custom models were accessible via separate services. The new offering combines both into a single API, along with other new products. You can also migrate existing projects to Vertex AI. If you have any feedback, please see the Get support page.

Vertex AI includes many different products to support end-to-end ML workflows. This lab focuses on the products highlighted below: Training/HP-Tuning and Notebooks.
